# Understanding attitudes towards cosmetic surgery among tertiary students in Macao
The book and movie “Moneyball” tells the story of Billy Beane, the Oakland Athletics general manager who put together a competitive baseball team despite having a restricted budget. His “secret” was the strategic use of data-driven methodology. I was inspired by this movie, so I used it to propose a data analysis project for a “Business Modeling and Simulation” course.
